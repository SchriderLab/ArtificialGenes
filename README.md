Using sparse transformers and other generative models to generate long DNA sequences

Initial Idea:

  Building on this paper: Creating Artificial Human Genomes Using Generative Models (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/769091v2.full.pdf), we're 
  trying to use a number of different generative models to generative realistic long DNA sequences. We're especially interested in the potential
  of Sparse Transformers, introduced here: https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.10509 which are generative transformer models especially good at long-range 
  sequence generation. 
  
  We'll start with a single population from the 1000 Genomes Project.
